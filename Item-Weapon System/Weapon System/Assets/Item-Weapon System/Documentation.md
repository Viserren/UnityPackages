## **How To Use**:
You shouldn't need to touch any of the core scripts in this package, nor the Scriptable object scripts, as this can cause errors in the custom inspector.

- When implementing into your own project make sure the "Data" folder is in the "Item-Weapon System/" directory and contains "Item", "Melee" and "Gun" folders as this is where it will create all of the different items and weapons.
